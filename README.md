# SLIMER

This readme covers how to run the GEANT4 simulation for SLIMER, as well as the current procedures for processing experimental data using ImageJ, and comparing experimental and simulation data using ROOT.


REQUIREMENTS
- CMake
- GEANT4
- ROOT
- ImageJ


CURRENT BUGS
- run.mac gets into an apparently infinite loop. 

GENERAL NOTES
- All filepaths in the code are set for my personal computer, and will need to be changed before the macros can be run.
- all_runs.pdf is the run log for the entire summer.
- Some runs end at a number that is not round because occasionally MicroManager would freeze right at the end of a run, especially on the longer ones.
- A copy of ImageJ has been included.


CONTENTS
code
- CMakeLists and exec.mac should be left alone.
- Run.mac should be modified depending on the desired simulation.

code_build
- Everything in this folder should be generated automatically. 
- Temporary changes can be made here, but will be overwritten next time the code is compiled.

other_code
- This folder contains all the root scripts used to view and compare data. See "ROOT/SCRIPTS" for more information.


RUNNING A SIMULATION
1. If the folder code_build does not already exist in parallel with code, create it. 

2. From code_build, run sudo cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/path/to/geant4.9.6.p04/lib[64]/Geant4-9.6.0/

3. From code_build, and as superuser, run make && make install. Note: running sudo make && make install does not work.

4. To run the macros, first run ./exec exec.mac and then ./exec run.mac.

5. To store the output from run.mac in a text file, use ./exec run.mac >> output.txt.


IMAGEJ
Images are analyzed through ImageJ with several macros, run in the following order: 
1. The getAverage macro takes the average of all the images in the set. This is to establish a baseline that can then be subtracted from every image in order to eliminate some background noise.

2. The subtractAverage macro subtracts the generated average from every image.

3. The gaussianBlur macro applies a gaussian blur to every image. This makes events more easily visible.

4. The getResults2 macro (there is no getResults1 or getResults) looks for peaks in each image, and records information about all of them that it finds.

5. The AllValuesLooped macro tests every image to see if it contains an event, and copies each image into either an "events" folder or a "noevents" folder.

Notes: 
- AllValuesLooped sorts the images after the gaussian blur has been applied to them. 
- All the other macros use every image, unsorted. The number of events per run is used in other data, but it's not important for the macros. 
- What we've found so far indicates that AllValuesLooped is fairly accurate, although it picks up about 50 images per 10000 as having events that do not have events. It has no way to account for multiple events per image. 
- It works by looking first for pixels that are above a certain grayscale brightness, and then searching for a certain number of pixels in a small square around the bright pixel that are above a different, slightly lower brightness.


ROOT/SCRIPTS
Note: All ROOT macros are run in the terminal with root -l macroname.C (or macroname.cc) unless otherwise stated.
- addTwoHists.C: The input of this macro can be changed, but its purpose is to add Sr and Y runs together to get a more accurate representation of the decay.
- graphToHist.C: This takes a graph from a TTree and changes it to a Histogram, to make it easier to manipulate.
- min_activity.C: Right now, this only plots specific numbers, which are found in a way I do not yet recall. It determines the minimum activity we should be able to detect in a 10000-image run.
- calgraph.C: Finding the endpoint of the grayscale peak height spectrum is important, as it should be calibrated to the spectrum of energy absorbed generated by the simulation. This macro plots the endpoint of eAbs on the y-axis and the endpoint of the gray value on the x-axis and fits a straight line to the data. The endpoint of eAbs is well known, and the endpoint of the grayscale can be found in two different ways: by eye, or by fitting the data to an exponential curve. One goal is to be able to fit the data well enough to determine the endpoint accurately, as getting it by eye is not consistent or reasonably possible with the amount of data that has to be considered. Note that there is data from multiple different radioactive sources here; the calibration between eAbs and grayscale should be consistent across all sources. 
- simcompare_with_ij2root.C: This macro needs to be run with root -l simcompare_with_ij2root.C /path/to/imagejfile. It takes the ImageJ file generated by the getResults2 macro, converts it to a .root file, and compares the peak height to the simulation eAbs data. Despite being a pretty short macro, this is where a lot of the meat of the project is. In particular, the constants a and b on lines 122 and 123 determine the calibration of simulation to the experiment, and the formulas in lines 107-109 generate a fit for the histograms.
